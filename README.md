# What is this library?

This library is an extension of [`Kruskal-AlmostFull`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Kruskal-AlmostFull) contained an detailed and expanded constructive/inductive proofs of:
- Higman's theorem for unary trees;
- and as a consequence, [Higman's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higman%27s_lemma) for lists.

The terminology and proof structure are largely inspired from the reference work of Wim Veldman on [An intuitionistic proof of Kruskal's theorem](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-003-0207-x) which is (IMHO) the reference work of the matter.
